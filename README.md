## About The Project

The project's idea was born while I was learning how to do a modal view in SwiftUI implementing UIKit. I was simply curious on the popover feature; so I did some research about it.
I discovered that this type of view presentation is available only on iPad for some HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) reason.
I know that we have all follow this simply rules and if there's a rule of what features we can use and where we can use them, we have to follow them.. but it's kind fun to be curious in life, no?

## Getting Started

Let's start talking about the project now!
First of all, I'm not going to explain every single line of code, but only the ones that are closely related to popover presentation.

### Prerequisites

Before continue I suggest you to learn the working process of NavigationView, List, Toolbar, Ternary Operator, If/Else Operator, @Binding and @State.

## Usage

This project contains two very different example; they're very different also in the hypothetical usage you could imagine for them.

* 1: The first one is just a variant of view presentation (like in the project the datepicker, but also many others).

* 2: The second one I know that is VERY borderline regarding the HIG, but maybe this type of popover could be usable anyway respecting the HIG.
